## Git Commit Messages (Suggested)
- `feat(delete): add delete superhero with confirmation dialog`
- `feat(report): generate summary statistics and save to file`
- `refactor: add GetSelectedHeroID helper for code reuse`
- `docs: add comprehensive comments for Person 3 features`

## Usage Instructions
1. **To Delete a Hero**:
   - Either enter a Hero ID in the textbox OR select a row in the grid
   - Click "Delete Superhero" button

```
HeroID,Name,Age,Superpower,ExamScore,Rank,ThreatLevel
```

## Architecture Updates
As part of Person 3 implementation, the entire project was restructured:
- **Organized folder structure**: Models/, Services/, UI/, Data/
- **Structured namespaces**: SuperheroDatabase.Models, SuperheroDatabase.Services, SuperheroDatabase.UI
- **Repository pattern**: Centralized data access through SuperheroRepository
- **Entity model**: Superhero class with proper encapsulation
- **Utility classes**: RankCalculator for business logic separation
- **File renamed**: Form1.cs → UI/SuperheroesForm.cs
- **Class renamed**: Superheroesfrm → SuperheroesForm

## Notes
- Fully integrated 3-tier architecture (UI → Services → Data)
- All features from Person 1 and Person 2 work seamlessly with new structure
- Repository pattern allows easy future enhancements (database integration, etc.)
- All new code follows proper OOP principles and coding conventions
- Summary report formatting is optimized for readability in both MessageBox and text file
- Data files now stored in dedicated Data/ folder for better organization
